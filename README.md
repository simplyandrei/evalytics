## Demo

#### Step 1: Define Your Grading Components

Start by setting up the structure of your course. Create Tabs that correspond to the grading criteria outlined in your syllabus (e.g., Quizzes, Midterms, Projects). For each tab, assign the specific percentage weight it contributes to the final grade.

#### Step 2: Input Raw Scores

Once your tabs are set up, click into a specific category to start logging your performance. Add a descriptive label for the activity (e.g., "Quiz 1F") along with your raw score and the total possible points.

#### Step 3: Edit & Adjust

Evalytics is designed to be flexible. If you made a typo or need to update a score after a regrade, simply click on any existing Tab or Score entry to modify it. The system allows you to change weights, labels, or raw scores on the fly.

#### Step 4: View Transmuted Results

As you input data, the application calculates your weighted average in real-time and runs it through the CIT-U Transmutation Table. Your estimated final grade is instantly displayed, giving you a clear picture of your academic standing.
